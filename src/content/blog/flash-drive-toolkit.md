# Brando's Toolkit – The Ultimate Automated Flash‑Drive Utility

> **TL;DR** – Paste a single PowerShell line (or run a tiny batch file) as Administrator, pick your USB drive, and the script does the rest: formats, creates three smart partitions, downloads 80+ tools, ISOs, drivers, and scripts, and leaves a spacious *files* partition for your personal data. All of this is 100 % AI‑generated code (Claude) with only minor tweaks.

---

## 🚀 Quick‑Start

### Option 1 – One‑liner (PowerShell, run as Administrator)
```powershell
iex (irm 'https://brando.tools/run')
```

### Option 2 – Download & run the batch file
1. Download **RUN_ME.bat** from the repo: <https://github.com/brand-o/tools/raw/refs/heads/main/RUN_ME.bat>
2. Right‑click → *Run as administrator*.

Both options launch the same PowerShell script under the hood.

---

## 📋 What the Script Does
1. **Auto‑detects** every connected flash drive.
2. Prompts you to **select** the target drive.
3. **Formats & partitions** the drive automatically (with a final confirmation).
4. **Downloads** 80+ tools, OS ISOs, drivers, and helper scripts from trusted sources.
5. **Organises** everything into a clean three‑partition layout.
6. Installs **Ventoy** – a boot‑loader that lets you drag‑and‑drop ISOs and boot them without re‑flashing.
7. Leaves a **“files”** partition for your own backups, documents, or any other data.
8. Provides **resume capability** – if the script is interrupted it can pick up where it left off or start over.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **Windows** with PowerShell (run as Administrator).
- **Fast USB flash drive** – 128 GB minimum, 256 GB+ recommended.
- **Internet connection** for the massive download step.
- **~30‑90 minutes** depending on drive speed and network.

> If you hit a *script‑execution‑policy* error, run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
```

## 📐 Partition Layout
| Partition | Size (typical) | Contents |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Ventoy** | 55 GB (≈ all ISOs + 20 % buffer) | Bootable Windows, Linux, Hiren’s, MemTest86, GParted, Clonezilla, etc. |
| **Utils** | 8 GB (tools & installers) | Portable apps, driver packs, helper scripts |
| **Files** | Remaining space (≈ 50‑60 GB on a 128 GB drive) | Your personal files, backups, documents |

The script will automatically create these three partitions and label them accordingly.

---

## 📦 Included Software (selected highlights)
- **Operating‑system ISOs** – 15 Windows 10/11, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.
- **Portable applications** – 31 utilities (7‑Zip, CPU‑Z, GPU‑Z, NirSoft suite, CrystalDiskInfo, …).
- **Installer applications** – 27 classic installers (Rufus, Balena Etcher, AOMEI Backupper, …).
- **Drivers** – Intel Wi‑Fi, Realtek LAN, NVIDIA/AMD GPU, USB 3 host drivers.
- **Browser extensions** & **helper scripts** for diagnostics and automation.
- **Special feature** – a **modded Windows 11 ISO** that the script can generate on‑the‑fly.

---

## ✨ Special Features & Philosophy
- **Open‑source & FOSS** – everything lives on GitHub under an MIT‑style license.
- **Promotes other OSS projects** – every tool linked is free or open‑source.
- **AI‑first development** – the entire PowerShell script was generated by Claude, with only minor manual corrections.
- **Demonstrates AI‑driven automation** – a script that creates another automation script.

## 🏎️ Recommended Flash Drives (real‑world Windows install times)
| Tier | Drive size & price | Typical install time |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Budget** | 128 GB, inexpensive, reliable | ~13 min |
| **Ultra‑Portable** | 64‑128 GB, key‑chain friendly | ~9 min |
| **Ultra‑Portable (High‑Speed)** | 128 GB, USB 3.2 Gen 2, higher write speed | ~8 min |
| **Ultra‑Fast** | 256‑512 GB, top‑tier NVMe‑style USB | ~5.5 min |

All drives are chosen for a mix of affordability, compactness, and raw speed. When my Amazon Associate account is restored I’ll add affiliate links.

## 🧑‍� How I Built It (in a day!)
1. Prompted Claude with a high‑level spec of “a one‑command flash‑drive toolkit that formats, partitions, downloads, and organizes everything”.
2. Refined the generated PowerShell until it ran clean on my test drive.
3. Added a tiny **RUN_ME.bat** wrapper for non‑PowerShell‑savvy users.
4. Documented the process in this blog post and pushed everything to <https://github.com/brand-o/tools>.

## � License & Credits
- **License:** MIT (see `LICENSE` in the repo).
- **Credits:** Massive thanks to Claude for the initial code generation, and to the open‑source community for the tools bundled inside.

## 📚 Final Thoughts
Brando's Toolkit turns a cheap USB stick into a **portable tech‑lab** in minutes. It’s open‑source, AI‑crafted, and leaves you with a generous *files* partition for personal data. Grab a drive, run the one‑liner, and you’ll have a bootable, fully‑stocked rescue kit ready for any situation.

*Happy hacking!*
