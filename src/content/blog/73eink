# I Built a 7.3″ E-Ink Flight Calendar Using Parts From Amazon

I wake up insanely early most days, and keeping track of duty periods, overnights, and next-day show times gets old fast. I wanted a clean, always-on display that shows:

- Today’s duty period  
- Tomorrow’s show time  
- Flight numbers + block times  
- Color-coded “on/off duty”  
- A simple weekly layout  

No tapping through apps.  
No unlocking my phone at 4 AM.  
Just a quiet little display sitting on my desk.

So I built one — using **Amazon parts** and a small bit of Python.

## 🧩 Parts List (Exact Products I Used)

### **7.3″ E-Ink Display**  
I used this exact one:

### **Picture Frame (5×7)**  
This is the clean wood frame mine sits in:

### **Raspberry Pi (Primary device driving the e-ink)**  
This powers the display and generates the images:

### **Optional: Orange Pi (Secondary webserver for JSON schedule data)**  
You *don’t* need this — I just used it as a tiny backend that serves my schedule JSON:

### Other small components:
- 32GB microSD card  
- USB-C power adapter  
- Short right-angle cable (keeps it clean in the frame)

## 🛠️ Why I Built It

I’m a pilot. That means ever-changing show times, overnights, and duty periods. The airline app works, but:

- it’s too bright at 4 AM  
- too many taps  
- not visible across the room  
- no “at-a-glance” clarity  
- no minimalist version that just shows the essentials  

I wanted something that runs quietly in the background and gives me the **only information that matters**.

E-ink is perfect for this:
- Almost **no power draw**  
- Always visible  
- Looks good on a desk  
- Refreshes without being distracting

## 🏗️ Hardware Build

The build is simpler than it looks.

### **1. Flash the Raspberry Pi OS**
I used Raspberry Pi OS Lite on a 32GB microSD.  
Flashed with Balena Etcher.

### **2. Fit the E-Ink Panel Into the Frame**
The 7.3″ panel fits inside a 5×7 frame almost perfectly.

I removed the frame backing, placed the panel inside, and used a tiny bit of electrical tape to hold it.

### **3. Route the Cable**
A short right-angle USB-C cable runs neatly out the back and into the Pi.

### **4. Mount the Pi**
Mine sits behind the frame with two small pieces of Velcro, invisible from the front.

### **5. Power**
A simple 5V/2A adapter powers the whole setup.

The whole thing draws barely anything — you can leave it plugged in 24/7.

## 💻 Software Setup

### **Raspberry Pi Duties:**
- Fetch today + tomorrow’s flight schedule  
- Render it into a PNG  
- Push the PNG to the e-ink display  
- Refresh every 20 minutes  

### **Orange Pi Duties (optional):**
- I run a tiny Flask server on it that returns a JSON version of my work schedule  
- The Raspberry Pi fetches that JSON and turns it into the display image  

You can skip this entirely and have the Raspberry Pi:
- log in to your scheduling app  
- fetch the calendar
- draw the PNG  
- update the screen  

### **Rendering the Calendar**

Mine shows:
- duty period  
- show times  
- block in/out  
- overnights  
- rest periods  
- AM/PM color coding  

Clean, minimal, and easy to understand at a glance.

## 🖼️ Final Look

The finished display looks like a little piece of modern desk art — not a DIY project.

I’ll embed the video once I film it, but here’s the idea:

- White background  
- Airline-style typography  
- Color accents  
- Auto updates  

Perfect on a nightstand or desk.
